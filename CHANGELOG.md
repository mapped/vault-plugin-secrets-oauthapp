## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2021-05-26

### Changed
* Add support for mutlitenant Azure AD apps that use client credentials flow. 
  This is done by giving an ability to override provider options to change the 
  auth URL

## [2.0.0] - 2021-04-09

### Changed

* [BREAKING] The path to configure a token for client credentials exchange has
  changed from `self/:name/config` to `config/self/:name`.
* [BREAKING] Deleting a client credentials exchange token no longer also deletes
  the configuration associated with it. To also delete the configuration, delete
  `config/self/:name` instead.
* The names of credentials are now unrestricted, except that they cannot end
  with a colon (`:`) character or have a colon immediately before a slash (`/`).

## [1.10.1] - 2021-04-07

### Fixed

* Fix a regression that caused the `minimum_seconds` field of a credential read
  request to be ignored.
* Correctly request updated user information when an OIDC token is refreshed.

## [1.10.0] - 2021-03-29

### Added

* The OAuth 2.0 device authorization flow (RFC 8628) is now supported by
  specifying `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code` when
  creating a credential.

### Changed

* Specifying a client secret when configuring the engine is now optional.

## [1.9.0] - 2021-01-19

### Added

* The OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow is now supported using the new `self`
  endpoints.

### Fixed

* Errors caused by configuration problems in the OIDC provider are now correctly
  propagated to the HTTP response with a 400 status code.
* The `nonce` provider option for the OIDC authorization code exchange is now
  passed to the ID token verification routine.
* Nonce validation is only performed during OIDC authorization code exchange or
  refresh token flow if the plugin user specifies a nonce to validate against;
  otherwise, it is assumed that the nonce data is invalid or non-conforming to
  the OpenID Connect Core specification.
* Per the OpenID Connect Core specification, ID tokens will only be revalidated
  during refresh if the server sends a new ID token. Otherwise, they are passed
  through unmodified from the original exchange.

### Changed

* The `testutil` package now uses a `*provider.Token` instead of a
  `*oauth2.Token` for mocks, allowing the `ExtraData` to be customized.
* It is now optional for providers to expose an authorization code URL.

## [1.8.3] - 2020-12-17

### Build

* Allow combined workflow to upload actual archives in addition to checksums.

## [1.8.2] - 2020-12-17

### Build

* Combine CI and release workflows so that release assets can be attached.

## [1.8.1] - 2020-12-17

### Build

* Fix workflow configuration to properly create GitHub releases.

## [1.8.0] - 2020-12-17

### Added

* Add support for OpenID Connect as a provider.

### Changed

* Use a collection of locks (256, distributed uniformly among credential keys)
  instead of a global mutex to improve performance.
* Because we now have a more complete OpenID Connect provider, the option to
  provide a `discovery_url` to the custom provider has been removed. Existing
  configurations that make use of the `discovery_url` will continue to work as
  intended.

### Build

* Switch to GitHub Actions and remove dependency on semantic-release.

## [1.7.0] - 2020-10-27

### Added

* Add `minimum_seconds` credential read option.

## [1.6.0] - 2020-09-28

### Added

* Allow additional characters in credential names.

## [1.5.0] - 2020-09-28

### Changed

* Log error codes from exchanging or refreshing tokens for debugging.

## [1.4.0] - 2020-09-28

### Added

* Add `discovery_url` provider option to the custom provider to allow discovery
  of a corresponding OAuth 2 endpoint.

## [1.3.0] - 2020-07-13

### Added

* Add support for Google as a provider.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-04-06

### Added

* Add `refresh_token` field when writing a new credential to handle cases where
  the OAuth 2 exchange initially occurred out of band.

## [1.1.1] - 2019-10-07

### Fixed

* Do not propagate API errors from providers when token refresh fails.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-19

### Added

* The token type is now returned as part of the credential read operation.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-09-18

### Added

* Initial release of the plugin.
